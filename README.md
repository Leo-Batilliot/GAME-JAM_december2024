# GAME-JAM
## What is this game's goal ?
This game is inspired by the famous platformer game Celeste  
Your goal is to climb your way to the top of each level:  
To do so, you have the ability to dash mid air once and climb walls.  
The game was made to be really hard ! it's okay and normal to fail !  
## Which file do I need to play ?
if you are on windows
- download the **`game_jam_windows.exe`** file
- launch the executable
if you are on linux  
- download the **`game_jam_linux.x86_64`** file
- launch the executable
## How to play ?
Here's a list of keys and their effect :
- **`WASD`** or **`ZQSD`** to move around
- **`SPACE`** to climb/grab walls
- **`LEFT ARROW`** to dash
- **`UP ARROW`** to jump

Try to experiment with jumps and dashes you might discover hidden mechanics.  
(if you are stuck on the third level I would recommend looking up Celeste wavedashing)  
Happy climbing !
